							 I always have had a passion for computers. I loved setting them up, helping others with their new pcs, and trying to fix any problem that I could. I guess you could call it a strong "love/hate" relationship!
								 
								 After high school my passion subsided. I met my wife soon after graduation. A little later my first-born shot into the world like a cannon ball (true story). Two years later my second son arrived. Both pregnancies were extremely difficult to where I had to leave work and take care of my wife and boys. The third pregnancy came along and it was a complete heart break. After we went through the horrific event, the equation equaled to uterine cancer. 
								 
								 This lead to a long wide search of professions that required little to no education. I was looking at all kinds of factors: Median Pay, Working with Hands or Mind, and Job Outlook.  Once I noticed the job outlook was so great, I started researching everything I could. It just seemed like the perfect fit. This is when I learned what coding bootcamps were, and what Flatiron was. 
								 
								 This continuance of passion is what is going to help with the burden of the financial struggle that is associated with the misfortune of this sickness.
With so much drive, and with me in the driverâ€™s seat...
Nothing can get in the way.
